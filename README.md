# 👋 Hey there! I’m Jay Chothiyawala

### 🧠 About Me

Hey 👋 I’m **Jay**, a caffeine-powered developer who lives in the Linux terminal and occasionally ventures out to the real world.  

I build stuff that works (most of the time), break things to learn faster 💥, and love watching ideas turn into lines of code that *just click!* 💡  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading tech blogs, geeking over architecture diagrams, or tweaking my setup for the 999th time 🧑‍💻.

Oh, and yeah  I’ve flirted a bit with the **MERN stack** 😏,  
but **Java** will *always be my second true love* ❤️  
(*My first?* Obviously my **computer and my laptop**. We’ve been through kernel panics together 🫶)
